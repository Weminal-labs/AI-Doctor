// The function burn is implemented to burn tokens from the specified account. It checks that the caller is a minter and the stablecoin is not paused.
// To implement this function, we need:
// Parameters:
// minter: &signer - The signer who is burning the tokens.
// from: address - The address from which the tokens will be burned.
// amount: u64 - The amount of tokens to be burned.
// Flow:
// Call burn_from(minter, primary_fungible_store::ensure_primary_store_exists(from, metadata()), amount) to perform the burn operation.
