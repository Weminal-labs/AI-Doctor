// The list_with_fixed_price function is implemented to list an object for sale at a fixed price. It sets up the necessary resources and transfers the object to an escrow account.
// To implement this function, we need:
// Parameters:
// seller: A reference to the signer's address who is listing the object.
// object: The object being listed for sale.
// price: The fixed price at which the object is being listed.
// Process:
// Create Object Constructor Reference
// Generate Transfer Reference: Generate a transfer reference for the newly created object.
// Disable Ungated Transfer: Disable ungated transfer for the object to prevent unauthorized transfers.
