// The function withdraw is implemented to ensure that the account is not denylisted and the stablecoin is not paused before allowing a withdrawal.
// To implement this function, we need:
// Parameters:
// store: Object<T> - The storage object from where the withdrawal will be made.
// amount: u64 - The amount to be withdrawn.
// transfer_ref: &TransferRef - A reference for the transfer operation.
// Flow:
// Call assert_not_paused() to ensure the stablecoin is not paused.
// Call assert_not_denylisted(object::owner(store)) to ensure the account is not denylisted.
// Perform the withdrawal operation using fungible_asset::withdraw_with_ref(transfer_ref, store, amount)
```
