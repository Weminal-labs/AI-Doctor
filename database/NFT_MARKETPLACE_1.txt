// In Move, we define object resources by marking structs with the key ability and annotating them as resource_group_member. This enables us to create distinct object accounts for each listing, encapsulating all relevant listing information within.
// We'll design our marketplace around two main structs: Listing and FixedPriceListing. This s eparation allows for future extensibility, such as supporting dynamic pricing models like auctions.
// Each listing creates its own object account, with Listing holding the token object and seller information, and FixedPriceListing specifying the price in a chosen CoinType (CoinType is specified as a generic type parameter).
// Resource Listing
// object: The token object to be listed. Here, we support token v2; this is a object reference (or a pointer) to the token object.
// seller: Seller account address.
// delete_ref: We need this capability to clean-up the object after purchase.
// extend_ref: We will escrow the token after listing (Listing object signer will hold the token), so we need ExtendRef to restore the object signer and call object::transfer when buyer wants to purchase.
//This struct represents a signer specific to the marketplace.
